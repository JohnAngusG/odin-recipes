    <h3>Description</h4>
    <p> The BLT is an over rated sandwich that is often misunderstood. People think that the highlight of the sandwich is the bacon, when really the tomato should be the main character. Bacon really is more of a supplementary meat than a main attraction anyways. For this recipe, you will want to find the juciest tomatos possible. </p>
