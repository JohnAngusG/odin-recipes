    <p>Not only is an omelette quick and easy to make, it is a paragon of economy. Odds and ends (a.k.a. leftovers) rise to a new level when placed inside an omelette.Leftover, cooked vegetables paired with a little cheese and folded into eggs present a much more cheerful meal than a bowl of vegetables haphazardly reheated in the microwave! </p>

        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
